## Overview
AI-Driven Test Automation & Agentic Testing Platform
Testsigma is a low-code, AI-powered test automation platform designed to empower development and QA teams to build, execute, analyze, and maintain tests more intelligently and efficiently in plain English.
Unlike traditional or open-source frameworks, Testsigma provides built-in AI agents that simplify and accelerate every stage of the testing lifecycle, from creation to optimization.
With a low-code, natural language interface, anyone in your team - QA engineers, developers, or product managers can contribute to test automation without writing complex scripts.
Testsigma integrates seamlessly with your CI/CD pipelines and cloud infrastructure, enabling continuous testing at scale.

**Highlights**

- AI Agents for test generation, execution, and maintenance
- Low-code authoring in natural language
- Unified testing for Web, Mobile, API, and AI
- Intelligent test healing and analytics
- Cloud-first, scalable execution
- Enterprise-grade security, collaboration, and integrations

**Why Testsigma**

- Agentic, not just automated - Uses AI ‚Äúagents‚Äù (Generator, Runner, Analyzer, Healer, Optimizer) to proactively assist in test creation, maintenance, execution, analysis, and optimization
- Low-code / Natural Language - Users can author tests using English-like sentences or minimal scripting, dramatically lowering the barrier for test automation
- Unified Across Layers - Supports Web, Mobile, API, ERP (e.g. Salesforce, SAP) testing from a single platform
- CI/CD & DevOps Friendly - Integrates seamlessly with popular CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing
- Scalable & Cloud-First - Deploys as a cloud-native SaaS solution, enabling parallel execution across multiple browsers/devices
- Intelligent Maintenance - Automatic test healing and optimization reduce long-term costs of flaky tests

**Generator Agent** - Automatically generates test scenarios based on requirements, UI, or APIs
**Runner Agent** - Executes tests across hundreds or thousands of parallel sessions to speed up validation
**Analyzer Agent** - Diagnoses test failures, highlights root causes, and recommends fixes
**Healer / Maintenance Agent** - Detects and auto-adapts to UI changes, minimizing manual repair effort
**Optimizer Agent** - Suggests test suite pruning, prioritization, and coverage improvements
**Cross-Platform Support** - Web, mobile (iOS/Android), API, desktop, and ERP systems
**Reporting & Analytics** - Dashboards, traceability, metrics, and failure insights
**CI/CD & Tooling Integrations** - Works with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, etc.
**Role-Based Access & Collaboration** - Teams can share test assets, version control, audit logs

## **Build & extend the platform with Add-ons**

Add-ons are custom extensions built and shared by the Testsigma Community at the [Add-ons Marketplace](https://testsigma.com/addons). Add-ons are built to automate unique user actions and test automation scenarios that are not possible with Testsigma‚Äôs default actions. 

You can build your own add-on using Testsigma SDK.

#### **Types of add-ons supported in Testsigma**

- **Custom Actions:** Testsigma provides a set of comprehensive, built-in addons that lets you automate most user actions in simple English. But sometimes you may need to automate actions unique to your AUT. For this, you can build custom add-ons to automate unique actions. See: [How to build a custom action in add-ons.](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-actions/)

- **Custom Data Generators:** Testsigma contains [default Data Generators](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/data-generators/defalut-list/) to generate instant test data for your automation scenarios. You can also build custom data generators. See: [How to build a custom data generator.](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-test-data-generators/)

- **Conditional If:** You can create an action to execute a sequence of steps if the condition is matched. You can write your own logic for the conditional if. See: [How to add conditional if actions.](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-conditional-if/)


- **While Loops:**  You can create an action to execute a sequence of steps until the condition is matched. You can write your own logic for the conditional if. See: [How to add while actions.](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-while-loops/)
