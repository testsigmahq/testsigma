## **Build & extend the platform with Add-ons**

Add-ons are custom extensions built and shared by the Testsigma Community at the [Add-ons Marketplace](https://testsigma.com/addons). Add-ons are built to automate unique user actions and test automation scenarios that are not possible with Testsigma’s default actions. 

You can build your own add-on using Testsigma SDK.

#### **Types of add-ons supported in Testsigma**

- **Custom Actions:** Testsigma provides a set of comprehensive, built-in addons that lets you automate most user actions in simple English. But sometimes you may need to automate actions unique to your AUT. For this, you can build custom add-ons to automate unique actions. See: [How to build a custom action in add-ons.](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-actions/)

- **Custom Data Generators:** Testsigma contains [default Data Generators](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/data-generators/defalut-list/) to generate instant test data for your automation scenarios. You can also build custom data generators. See: [How to build a custom data generator.](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-test-data-generators/)

- **Conditional If:** You can create an action to execute a sequence of steps if the condition is matched. You can write your own logic for the conditional if. See: [How to add conditional if actions.](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-conditional-if/)


- **While Loops:**  You can create an action to execute a sequence of steps until the condition is matched. You can write your own logic for the conditional if. See: [How to add while actions.](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-while-loops/)
