<br/>
 

Powerful open-source test automation platform for websites, mobile apps & API. Write tests in simple English, auto-capture elements, parametrize testing with built-in test data generators, instant APIs for integrations, customize for unique use-cases with 100+ pre-built add-ons or build your own with SDKs.


## **Quick start: One click deployment on Testsigma Cloud**

The easiest way to start your automation journey is with Testsigma Cloud.

**CTA: Deploy Testsigma Cloud (Image take it from figma)**

Once you deploy, you can follow the below tutorials to get started
1. [Web application Automated testing](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/getting-started/automate-web-applications/)
2. [Mobile Web application Automated testing](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/getting-started/automate-mobile-web-applications/)
3. [iOS Apps Automated testing](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/getting-started/automate-android-applications/)
4. [Android Apps Automated testing](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/getting-started/automate-ios-applications/)

## **Other deployment options**
We have 2 more deployment options to choose from

1. [Using Docker](https://testsigma.com/docs/getting-started/setup/docker/)
2. [Using Downloadable Package](https://testsigma.com/docs/getting-started/setup/downloadable-package/) 

## **Features**

### Test Development
-  Write code-agnostic, human-readable tests in plain English with built-in NLP Grammar.
- Generate airtight test scripts for web and mobile apps using Test Recorder.
- Integrate automated API calls within your functional/UI test steps.

### Data-Driven/Parameterized Testing
- Upload test data sets as (file format) files.
- Use built-in data generators for mock test data (what types of strings are supported).
- Create your own custom data generators as add-ons.

### Visual Testing

Enable visual testing with a toggle while creating a test plan.

### Run Results

Debug using screenshots, videos, text logs, and more. Generate custom reports at test, module, test suite, or device/system levels. 

### Integrations

Integrate with any CI tool for continuous testing.


- **Write tests in English**

    Now everyone in your team including devs, QAs and SMEs can contribute to writing test scripts using simple english & speed up test creation.

- **Convert user actions into test steps**

    Testsigma recorder converts your user actions in the application into editable test steps. We‚Äôve also maintained the flexibility of being able to add steps in between manually using simple English.

- **Test Data management**

    You can directly add your data sets into test data profiles and use them in tests without any integration effort. You can also upload data files in excel format.

- **Run on the cloud**

    Testsigma comes equipped with a cloud-powered test lab(Testsigma Lab) that hosts over 800+ Browser and OS version combinations and over 2000+ real devices to run your tests on. You no longer have to maintain expensive infrastructure for tests

- **AI-powered Maintenance**

    Say goodbye to constantly fixing flaky test cases that break under any code change and let our AI do the work for you with an intelligent auto-heal feature. AI also identifies all affected test cases from a fail run and automatically creates your regression test plan

- **Results & Reports**

    You can view the step-wise results of your execution in real time. Analyze and debug your tests better with screenshots and recorded videos of your test runs. Generate custom reports for individual tests, modules as well at test suite and device/system level.

- **Integrated API testing**

    Supplement your functional test scenarios by integrating automated API calls within your test steps. Write automated api tests without any code.

- Unified Platform: Automate Web, Mobile Web, Android, iOS, API etc..

- Flexibility to Extend: Install add-ons from marketplace or create your own for unique 

- Visual Testing:

## **Build & extend the platform with Add-ons**

Add-ons are custom extensions built and shared by the Testsigma Community at the [Add-ons Marketplace](https://testsigma.com/addons). Add-ons are built to automate unique user actions and test automation scenarios that are not possible with Testsigma‚Äôs default au actions. 

You can build your own add-on using Testsigma SDK.

**Types of add-ons supported in Testsigma**

- **Custom Actions:** Testsigma has a comprehensive, built-in actions that lets you automate most user actions in simple English. But sometimes you may need to automate actions unique to your AUT. You can build your own actions and automate those unique actions using add-ons. See: [How to build a custom action in add-ons.](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-actions/)

- **Custom Data Generators:** Testsigma has [default Data Generators](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/data-generators/defalut-list/) to generate test data for your automation. You can also create your own data generators. See: [How to build a custom data generator.](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-test-data-generators/)

- **Conditional If:** You can create an action to execute a sequence of steps if the condition is matched. You can write your own logic for the conditional if. See: [How to add conditional if actions.](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-conditional-if/) 

- **While Loops:** You can create an action to execute a sequence of steps until the condition is matched. You can write your own logic for the conditional if. See: [How to add while actions.](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-while-loops/)
