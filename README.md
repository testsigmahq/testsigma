## Overview
Testsigma is a GenAI-powered, codeless test automation platform that makes it fast and easy for quality engineering teams to automate tests at speed and scale without dependence on developers to build and maintain traditional test frameworks. 
With Testsigma Copilot and Atto built into its codeless automation platform, Testsigma lets QA teams generate test cases and scenarios based on various input sources like user stories, designs, user journeys and even live applications across web, mobile, desktop and enterprise applications like Salesforce and SAP using prompt engineering.
Requiring near-zero initial setup cost and training time, Testsigma enables anyone in the QA team to instantly write automated tests 10X faster using Testsigma Copilot and run them on thousands of devices available on the public cloud or your own private cloud. Put your test maintenance on autopilot mode using Testsigma’s AI-driven self-healing, thus reducing maintenance time and effort by 90%.
Testsigma integrates natively with more than 30 popular tools and technologies used by QA teams, including CI/CD, bug reporting, real device labs, project management and collaboration tools.
Hundreds of leading enterprises across the world use Testsigma to release quality software. Some notable customers of Testsigma include Cisco, Samsung, KFC, Nestle, and Zeiss.
Testsigma is headquartered in San Francisco with engineering teams in Bangalore and Chennai. Testsigma is backed by marquee investors like MassMutual, Accel, Strive, and Bold Cap.

## **Build & extend the platform with Add-ons**

Add-ons are custom extensions built and shared by the Testsigma Community at the [Add-ons Marketplace](https://testsigma.com/addons). Add-ons are built to automate unique user actions and test automation scenarios that are not possible with Testsigma’s default actions. 

You can build your own add-on using Testsigma SDK.

#### **Types of add-ons supported in Testsigma**

- **Custom Actions:** Testsigma provides a set of comprehensive, built-in addons that lets you automate most user actions in simple English. But sometimes you may need to automate actions unique to your AUT. For this, you can build custom add-ons to automate unique actions. See: [How to build a custom action in add-ons.](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-actions/)

- **Custom Data Generators:** Testsigma contains [default Data Generators](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/data-generators/defalut-list/) to generate instant test data for your automation scenarios. You can also build custom data generators. See: [How to build a custom data generator.](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-test-data-generators/)

- **Conditional If:** You can create an action to execute a sequence of steps if the condition is matched. You can write your own logic for the conditional if. See: [How to add conditional if actions.](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-conditional-if/)


- **While Loops:**  You can create an action to execute a sequence of steps until the condition is matched. You can write your own logic for the conditional if. See: [How to add while actions.](https://testsigma.com/tutorials/addons/how-create-addons-while-loops/)
